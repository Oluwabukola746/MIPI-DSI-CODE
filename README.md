The MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI) is commonly used for high-speed communication between processors and display modules. It is crucial for integrating SoCs (System on Chip) with mobile displays in devices like smartphones, tablets, automotive displays, and wearable gadgets. MIPI DSI is a high-speed differential serial interface used for transmitting pixel data and control information from a host (e.g., GPU/SoC) to a display.
MIPI DSI is a high-speed interface that is used in applications such as smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and other embedded display applications. The Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance (MIPI) developed a serial communication protocol known as the Display Serial Interface or DSI. Other display interfaces such as RGB and parallel require a higher number of pins to support high resolution and refresh rates. The MIPI display serial interface requires fewer pin connections while maintaining the same level of performance.
